We thank Lukas Elflein for supporting the development of
`matscipy.electrochemistry` and the according example notebooks, Christian
Seidl for early experimentation with the module's functionality, Andreas
Greiner for discussions and inspirations on solving transport problems with
controlled-volume and finte-elements methods, as well as Meng Yonggang and
Zhang Jun for posing an interesting tribological problem that sparked the
development of this module initially.
