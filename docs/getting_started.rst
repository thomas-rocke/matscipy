`matscipy`
==========

Matscipy is a generic materials science toolbox built around the `Atomic
Simulation Environment (ASE) <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`__. It provides
useful routines for electrochemistry, dislocations, fracture mechanics, tribology and others.

Getting started
---------------

`matscipy` can used in two different modes: As a library in your own Python code or using the command-line interface.
The command-line interface implements specific workflows on top of the library.

Using the library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an example of how to use the programmatic interface, explore the
`computation of elastic constants <applications/elastic_constants.html>`_ or how to
`build systems with cracks <applications/fracture_mechanics.html>`_.

Via the command-line interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command line interface packages workflows. Common workflows include the
`computation of root-mean-square displacements for diffusion problems <cli/diffusion.html>`_ or the
`quenching of amorphous structures <cli/structure.html>`_.
