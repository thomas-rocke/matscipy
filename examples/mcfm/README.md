# Multi Cluster Force Mixing (MCFM) example

This directory contains example input files and scripts for the MCFM calculator.

Run the `example_simulation.py` script to start the simulation. This is a self-contained example which uses two Morse potentials with different parameters in place of 'real' QM and MM calculators.
