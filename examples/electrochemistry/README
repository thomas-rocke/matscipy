This folder contains sample bash scripts making use of the electrochemistry 
module's command line interface for simple parametric sweeps.

Look into the *_batch subfolders. Run a sample 'pipeline'
of poisson-nernst-planck, continuous2discrete and stericify
from within this folder, i.e. with

    bash pcs_pipeline.sh 2>&1 | tee pcs_pipeline.log

and check the results below above-mentioned sub-folders.

png files show sample results from batch sweeps.
